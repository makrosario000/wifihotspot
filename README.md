# requirements
Operating System: windows7(64-bit), windows10(64-bit)
A laptop/desktop connected to the internet via LAN cable and has WIFI module (laptops have this by default, for desktops you need a wifi dongle)

# What is this

this is for sharing for internet connection via WIFI.
e.g. your laptop is connected to your router via LAN cable and you want to use the laptop as a WIFI accesspoint (like what a router does)

# How to use

1.1 right click "SETUP" and click "run as administrator" (if windows security window opens just click "run anyway")
1.2 a terminal window will open and ask you for the wifi-name(SSID) and password
2.1 right click "START" and click "run as administrator" (if windows security window opens just click "run anyway") your devices should now be able to see the WIFI hotspot using the wifiname you have setup
3. right click "START" and click "run as administrator" (if windows security window opens just click "run anyway") if you want to end your hotspot

# Notes

if you encounter issues just try to "STOP" and "START" the hotspot again
